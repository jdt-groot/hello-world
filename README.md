# hello-world
This is my first repository
My wife left me home alone this week so I've had Taco Bell and I'm also considering getting Pizza Hut tonight. She's not the biggest fan of either. 
I also started watching Game of Thrones again. 
Tomorrow I'm grilling a huge steak and I don't have to share it with anyone.
Okay I lied, I'll share a bit with the two cats
